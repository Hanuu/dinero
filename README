Recently, the cryptocurrency suh as bitcoin, and ethereum, has been gaining it's attention to the world.
Particularly in Korea, the price of ethereum has been fluctuating between 380,000 won to 160,00 won during this week(22 May ~ 31 May).
I am pretty sure there are many reasons behind this 'unpredictable' fluctuation. However, the question is, what kind of relationship does it have with the people's interest.
Right now, the price of bitcoin and ethereum is 20~40% higher in Korea than in United States. In terms of currency, this usually doesn't happen, as the money flows from high to low, it should balance itself out.
I came to the conclusion that most people that are investing in crytocurrency in Korea is viewing those new coins as investment products and not a new form of technology.
In order to unreveil this mystery, and to try data analytics using python, I launch project dinero.
